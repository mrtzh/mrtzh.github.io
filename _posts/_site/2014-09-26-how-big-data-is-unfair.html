<p>Head on over to <a href="https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-is-unfair-9aa544d739de">Medium</a>
for a non-technical general audience piece I wrote on <em>why machine learning is not, by

<p>Since I first wrote this post thereâ€™s been some interesting follow up by
<a href="https://medium.com/@hannawallach/big-data-machine-learning-and-the-social-sciences-927a8e20460d">Hanna
Wallach</a>.
Also be sure to check out the web site of the <a href="http://www.fatml.org">NIPS workshop</a> on fairness,
accountability and transparency that Solon Barocas and I organized.</p>
