<p>Some may have noticed that this blog was an utter mess for about two weeks.
This was due to an exploited vulnerability in Wordpress leaving my blog 
in a state most curiously difficult to recover from. The only thing not
corrupted by this horrific cyberattack (possibly of North Korean origin) 
was an SQL database dump of my blog
that turned out to be inconsistent with a fresh Wordpress install. The
Wordpress support team thankfully pointed me to a number of videos
explaning carefully how to move my mouse
cursor from one point to another. I feel a lot more confident now with the mouse
cursor. In the
end, I more or less manually moved my blog to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> hosted by
<a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub</a> with <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> comments.
It’s a pretty decent combination that a lot of people seem to be transitioning
to.</p>

<p>If you ever think about starting a blog, <em>do not</em> go with Wordpress. If you absolutely
cannot resist the temptation, by all means do not maintain your own Wordpress
install. Wordpress is slow, clunky and insecure. I had to install updates
multiple times a month and even that was evidently not enough to stay on top.</p>

<p>On a positive note, I appear to be on paternity leave right now—for another
five weeks or so—and I hope to write a blog post or two in those moments
when I’m not spending quality time with my bicycles, ehm, and my daughter, of
course.</p>
