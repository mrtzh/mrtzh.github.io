<p>I've finally managed to get on the TCS aggregator! That is under the condition that I use a special tag indicating that my post may be mathy enough for the greater aggregator community. Since I've been blogging about the Big Data program at the brand new Simons Institute in Berkeley, let me mention two posts that already happened:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://mrtz.org/blog/the-zen-of-gradient-descent/">The Zen of Gradient Descent</a> - Some thoughts on gradient descent, how to accelerate it, and its connection to eigenvalue computation. These are things I wish I had learned six years. This post is loosely based on a fantastic lecture by Ben Recht at the Institute last week.</li>
<li><a href="http://mrtz.org/blog/what-should-a-theory-of-big-data-do/">What should a theory of Big Data do?</a> As I'm attending a program with that name for an entire semester, it seems like a fair question to raise. Is it all about scalability? I argue that it is something else. Suresh wrote an interesting <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2013/08/on-theory-of-big-data.html">response</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To follow future posts, it's probably best to subscribe to the <a href="http://mrtz.org/blog/feed/">RSS feed</a>Â or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mrtz">Twitter</a>. It's quite likely that I will regularly forget to use my special tag so that posts don't appear on the aggregator. If you're already following me, I apologize for the redundant post.</p>
