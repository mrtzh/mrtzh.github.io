Some may have noticed that this blog was an utter mess for about two weeks.
This was due to an exploited vulnerability in Wordpress leaving my blog 
in a state most curiously difficult to recover from. The only thing not
corrupted by this hack was an SQL database dump of my blog
that turned out to be inconsistent with a fresh Wordpress install. 

The Wordpress support team thankfully pointed me to a number of videos
explaning carefully how to move my mouse
cursor from one point to another. I feel a lot more confident now with the mouse
cursor. In the
end, I more or less manually moved my blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) hosted by
[GitHub](https://pages.github.com) with [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments.
It's a pretty decent combination that a lot of people seem to be transitioning
to. 

If you ever think about starting a blog, *do not* go with Wordpress. 
If you absolutely
cannot resist the temptation, by all means do not maintain your own Wordpress
install. 

> Wordpress is slow, clunky and insecure. 

I had to install updates
multiple times a month and even that was evidently not enough to stay on top.

On a positive note, I appear to be on paternity leave right now---for another
five weeks or so---and I hope to write a blog post or two in those moments
when I'm not spending quality time with my bicycles, ehm, and my daughter, of
course.
