Head on over to [Medium](https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-is-unfair-9aa544d739de)
for a non-technical general audience piece I wrote on *why machine learning is not, by
default, fair or just in any meaningful way.*

Since I first wrote this post there's been some interesting follow up by
[Hanna
Wallach](https://medium.com/@hannawallach/big-data-machine-learning-and-the-social-sciences-927a8e20460d).
Also be sure to check out the web site of the [NIPS workshop](http://www.fatml.org) on fairness,
accountability and transparency that Solon Barocas and I organized.
